The MVC architectural pattern has existed for a long time in software engineering(SE). All the languages use MVC with slight variation, but concep is same.

MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application into three components: Model, View, and Controller.

Model: Model represents the data's shape. A class in C# is used to describe a model. Model objects store data retrieved from the database.
