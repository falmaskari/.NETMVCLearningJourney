The MVC architectural pattern has existed for a long time in software engineering<b>(SE)</b>. All the languages use MVC with slight variation, but concep is same.

MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application into three components: Model, View, and Controller.

<b>Model:</b> Model represents the data's shape. A class in C# is used to describe a model. Model objects store data retrieved from the database.

<b>View:</b> View is a user interface<b>(UI)</b>. It display model data to the user and enables them to modify them. View in .NET MVC is <b>HTML, CSS, and some special syntax</b> that ease to communicate with the model and the controller.

<b>Controller:</b> It handles the user request. Typically, the user uses the view and raises an <b>HTTP</b> request, which will be handled by the controller. The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response.
